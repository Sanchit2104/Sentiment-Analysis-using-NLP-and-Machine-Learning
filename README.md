# Sentiment Analysis Project Description
# Project Title: Sentiment Analysis Using Python, NLP, and Machine Learning
# Overview:
This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis model that classifies text data (such as customer reviews, social media posts, or survey responses) into different sentiment categories—Happy , angry and sad. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, the project extracts meaningful insights from textual data to determine sentiment polarity and predicts the sentiment of customers and helps in increasing customer satisfaction.

# Key Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: NLTK,TextBlob, scikit-learn,Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib,Seaborn,Word Cloud

Machine Learning Models: Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Algorithms

Data Processing: Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stopword Removal, TF-IDF, Word Embeddings

# Project Workflow:
# Data Collection:

Used the Customer reviews Dataset to identify and predict the sentiments.

# Data Preprocessing:

Clean the text (removing punctuation, special characters, stopwords).

Convert text to numerical format using TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or BERT embeddings.

# Model Training:

Train a machine learning model (Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, or Random Forest.

Optimize hyperparameters for better accuracy.

# Model Evaluation:

Use precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy metrics and Roc Auc Score for Evaluation.

# Visualization & Deployment:

Create dashboards using Matplotlib, or Seaborn.

Deployed the Model using Streamlit Library and Created a Web Application for the Model for predicting the Sentiments

# Applications:
Social media monitoring (Twitter sentiment analysis).

Customer feedback analysis for businesses.

Market research and brand reputation tracking.
